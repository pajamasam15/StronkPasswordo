# StronkPasswordo
Tests strength of password with scale.

To do list:

-dealing with common changes to words to make the password harder to guess: I've been looking into Regular Expressions and this looks doable
- let's try and give a more mathematical look at the strength of passwords. If someone could make a method that looks to see if it was just on a list then it's a low metric and it varies in complexity as more is added, that would be wonderful. This is pretty important so if someone could get on this ASAP it would help a lot.
- finally, if someone could take on checking if it's two words stuck together, or a word/common password with some numbers of characters at the end that would be amazing
- modify the code for the stress test indicator to be more complex (Nguyen's got this.)
